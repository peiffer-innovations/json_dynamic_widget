## [7.0.0+2] - September 16th, 2023

This is a huge release with several breaking changes.  It brings in the ability to automatically create the widget JSON / YAML binding via a code generator.

* **BREAKING JSON CHANGES**: The following changes can be automatically migrated via the [migration CLI](doc/MIGRATION_CLI.md)
    * Both `child` and `children` have moved into the `args` for all widgets.
    * For `conditional` the `child` is no longer supported and must be in `args['onTrue']`.
    * For `scaffold` the `child` is no longer supported and must be in `args['body']`.
    * The values for `set_default_value` are no longer directly on the map and must be passed in with the key `values`.
    * The values for `set_value` are no longer directly on the map and must be passed in with the key `values`.
    * The values for `set_widget` are no longer directly on the map and must be passed in with the key `widgets`.
    * The `tween_animation` widget was renamed to the more correct `tween_animation_builder`.
    * The framework no longer auto-listens to changes.  To have a widget updated when an underlying value changes, the `listen` value must be provided to the widget.
* **BREAKING CODE CHANGES**:
    * The `numSupportedWidgets` parameter was removed from `JsonWidgetData`.
* **Performance**: a performance improvement was made to move the dynamic arg parsing to render time rather than up front.  This helps performance with large lists because the processing happens as the list is scrolled rather than up front.
* **Code Generation**: A code generator is now in place to be able to create auto-bindings from widgets to the JSON data.  For more details, see the [Code Generation](doc/CODE_GENERATOR.md) guide.
* **JSON / YAML Generation**: Introduced in this version includes the ability to be able to generate JSON or YAML from Dart code.  For more information see the [Reverse Encoding](doc/REVERSE_ENCODING.md) guide.
* **Annotations** See the [Annotations](doc/ANNOTATIONS.md) guide for information on the new code generation / reverse encoding annotations that are supported.
